# **I-watcher — I’m watching you**
Made by 資管3A林冠廷

# Overview
Why I want to do this project ?
It is quite troublesome to take out the key from the bag to open the door every time I go home. Especially when I just came home from shopping. My hands were full but I still need to find out the key from my bag.  I wish the door could open by itself every time. So i want to make a machine that can open the door just by my face. Then I’ll never have to find the key to open the door anymore.

On the other hand, if relatives and friends visit my home, the host can also control the door lock directly through Telegram bot without opening the door personally.

## How to use this machine ?
1. First of all, you have to download telegram, a communication APP. Then establish a connection with I-Watcher , the bot on telegram.
2. Second, type in “Add new face” in the chat box,  and the camera will turn on to try to capture your face. Please use it in a place with sufficient light sources, otherwise the machine can’t find the face. After capturing the face, I-Watcher will tell you that your face has been stored.
3. Third, type in "Train" in the chat box to train a new face recognition model. After training, I-Watcher will tell you that your face has been trained.
4. Now, we can start using facial recognition to unlock the door! Type in “Turn on the camera” to turn on the pi camera, then camera will turn on and start to recognize face. 
    1. If I-Watcher recognizes your face, I-Watcher will unlock the door for five seconds and play a welcome home sound effect. Simultaneously，send a welcome home message in telegram. 
    2. If it cannot recognize your face, It will play a sound effect to warn the stranger. And take a photo of stranger and send it to the owner's mobile phone. Finally, the camera will be turned off automatically.

## Commands you can use in I-Watcher

- Start : to check if your bot wakeup
    - Reply : “Ok,sir!”
- Open the door : to open the door lock
    - Reply : “Door’s been opened.”
- Close the door : to close the door
    - Reply : “Door’s been closed.”
- Add new face :
    - Reply1 : Please face the camera with your front face.
    - Reply2 : I've gotten your face!
- Train :
    - Reply1 : Ok, I'm training now. Wait a minute please.
    - Reply2 : I can recognize your face now!
- Turn on the camera :
    - Reply1 : Welcome home,my lord.
    - Reply2 : There is a stranger outside your door!!
    - Reply3 : The camera will be turned off in few seconds.

⚠️All the commands can only be used when camera is off.

## Feature list

1. Open the solenoid lock.
2. Close the solenoid lock.
3. Use pi camera to get new faces.
4. Train the facial recognition model.
5. Recognize the face in the database.
6. Make sound effect whether it detect the stranger or someone it know.
7. Send the stranger’s profile to the host’s mobile phone.
8. Do all the features above in telegram.

## Install opencv on your raspberrypi

There are several ways can install opencv on your raspberrypi. After my several attempts, this is the best way to install opencv.

Other ways : [樹莓派4b安裝OpenCV 新手推薦 | IT人 (iter01.com)](https://iter01.com/577788.html)

```python
sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-dev python3-opencv
```

⚠️If you want to download all packages and libraries, and compile them by yourself, it will take a lot of time and you are likely to get fail, please think twice.

## Install Python telegram Bot

```python
sudo pip install telepot
```

## Install pygame

To make your speaker can work. Type in this command on your terminal then you’ll hear the speaker’s sound.

```python
speaker-test -c2 -twav -17
```

Install command

```python
sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
```

# Start

## Facial recognition


### Test your camera

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
cap.set(3,640) # set Width
cap.set(4,480) # set Height
while(True):
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    frame = cv2.flip(frame, -1) # Flip camera vertically
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
    cv2.imshow('gray', gray)
    
    k = cv2.waitKey(30) & 0xff
    if k == 27: # press 'ESC' to quit
        break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

The above code will capture the video stream that will be generated by your PiCam, displaying both, in BGR color and Gray mode.

To finish the program, you must press the key [ESC] on your keyboard. Click your mouse on the video window, before pressing [ESC].

### Facial detection

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('Cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
cap.set(3,640) # set Width
cap.set(4,480) # set Height
while True:
    ret, img = cap.read()
    img = cv2.flip(img, -1)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = faceCascade.detectMultiScale(
        gray,     
        scaleFactor=1.2,
        minNeighbors=5,     
        minSize=(20, 20)
    )
    for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
        cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
        roi_gray = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        roi_color = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]  
    cv2.imshow('video',img)
    k = cv2.waitKey(30) & 0xff
    if k == 27: # press 'ESC' to quit
        break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

The above code are all you need to detect a face, using Python and OpenCV.

```python
faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('Cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
```

Remember the path is the absolute path of “haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml”.

### Step 1 : Get data

```python
import cv2
import os
cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
cam.set(3, 640) # set video width
cam.set(4, 480) # set video height
face_detector = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
# For each person, enter one numeric face id
face_id = input('\n enter user id end press <return> ==>  ')
print("\n [INFO] Initializing face capture. Look the camera and wait ...")
# Initialize individual sampling face count
count = 0
while(True):
    ret, img = cam.read()
    img = cv2.flip(img, -1) # flip video image vertically
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_detector.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.3, 5)
    for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x,y), (x+w,y+h), (255,0,0), 2)     
        count += 1
        # Save the captured image into the datasets folder
        cv2.imwrite("dataset/User." + str(face_id) + '.' + str(count) + ".jpg", gray[y:y+h,x:x+w])
        cv2.imshow('image', img)
    k = cv2.waitKey(100) & 0xff # Press 'ESC' for exiting video
    if k == 27:
        break
    elif count >= 60: # Take 30 face sample and stop video
         break
# Do a bit of cleanup
print("\n [INFO] Exiting Program and cleanup stuff")
cam.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Use this code you can get 30 photos in 10 seconds
